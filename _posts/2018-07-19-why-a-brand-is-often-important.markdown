## 记笔记的方法：

1. 瞬时笔记：随时准备记录下idea, 不要在意细节，这样会不愿意动笔，它只是用来提醒你想起它们来。最好一天之内可以整理它们。
2. 文献笔记：对读过的文献做笔记，简短，不要照搬，用自己的话。复述代表着真的理解。
3. 永久笔记：回顾1，2，在忘掉之前。重点不是收集，而是得到启发。这时的笔记应该是像写个别人看的一样，用整句话解释来源，参考了什么，用词准确，简单，清晰。可以扔掉第1步的笔记，保留2，3.
4. 整理2，3的笔记：1）存档，2）添加相关的链接，3）确保可以retrieve, 无论是索引还是之后做了主题性的总结。
5. 从已有的笔记中整理主题，问题，看看缺少什么，继续挑战或者强化自己的观点。整理一下，看看缺什么，什么是多余的，不要等到万事俱备再行动，而是不断验证你的观点，给自己足够的时间回顾，继续阅读，做笔记，完善观点，改善论述和结构。
6. 把笔记转写成手稿，而不是照搬，这是再理解的方式。

Ummm…to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Your best is an idiot! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I'm Santa Claus! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Noooooo! I can explain. It's very valuable.

I'm Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.

It doesn't look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! You're going to do his laundry? Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.

Bender, we're trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.
